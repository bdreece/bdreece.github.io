### About Me

  My name is Brian Reece, I am 22 years old, and I am an undergraduate student at
  Michigan Technological University, with a major in Software Engineering and a
  minor in Communication Studies. I will be graduating in the spring semester of 2022
  with my Bachelor's of Science degree, and hope to begin my embedded systems
  programming journey shortly thereafter. 

  I began experimenting with programming around the age of 13, first making simple
  text-based games with Windows batch scripts, and then moving on to Unity3D once
  I got the hang of it.

  While my introduction to computer programming was through
  game development, my passion for it didn't set in until I began delving into the
  embedded world: writing bare-metal C code for microcontrollers and developing
  libraries for hardware abstraction. I had joined the Aerospace enterprise at
  Michigan Tech, and while being thrust into a nearly completed project threw me
  off, being tasked with the development of serial device drivers for the Auris
  micro-satellite's payload subsystem very much cemented my desire to continue this
  line of work.

  From there, I knew that this would be the field I eventually want
  to work in. However, in the meantime, I am working to hone my skills and become
  a better all-around software developer through learning web, mobile, and desktop
  GUI development.

  With my software development background out of the way, in my free time I also
  love to hike, rock climb, kayak, and ski. I love to get outside and enjoy being
  among the elements, I think because it reminds me of where we came from as a
  species.
